MovieSystem by using Rest API



Entities
The core objects of this application are: 
a) Movie
b) Actor
c) Producer

Relationships
The relationships among the entities are
a) An actor can act in multiple movies
b) A movie can have multiple actors 
c) A movie has only one producer
d) A producer can produce multiple movies

Each Entity can able to perform POST(), GET(), DELETE() and have tested through POSTMAN Tool

By defaulty it will show https://localhost:44350/api/values , But we can change to our requirement

Actor : POST Method : https://localhost:44350/api/Actors
        get method :  https://localhost:44350/api/Actors/1



Movies : Post method: https://localhost:44350/api/Movies
         get Method : https://localhost:44350/api/Movies/1
         
Producers : POST METHOD : https://localhost:44350/api/Producers/
            Get method : https://localhost:44350/api/Producers/1
            
I would like to attach the document having few Postman Scrrenshots.
            
            
            Happy Coding..!
